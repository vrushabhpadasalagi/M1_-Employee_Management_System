Software Requirements

Embedded C

In microcontrollers, the embedded c programming language is utilised. The embedded C programming language is a general-purpose programming language with code efficiency, organised programming principles, and a
large number of operators. Embedded C is a small programming language that isn't intended for a single application. Embedded C is a convenient and effective programming option for a wide range of software jobs because of
its lack of restrictions. Many problems can be solved more quickly and easily embedded C than they can with other more specialised languages. The embedded c language is incapable of performing activities (such as input and
output) that would typically necessitate operating system involvement. Because these functions are segregated from the language, embedded c is well-suited to writing code that runs on a variety of systems.
